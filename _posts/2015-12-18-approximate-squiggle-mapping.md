Over at the [Simpson Lab blog](http://simpsonlab.github.io/blog/),
I have an post describing a novel method for [Directly Mapping
Squiggle Data](http://simpsonlab.github.io/2015/12/18/kdtree-mapping/),
using k-d trees to map segmented kmers; a simple [proof of
concept](https://github.com/ljdursi/simple-squiggle-pseudomapper)
is available on github.
