title:  "Jupyter Notebooks for Performing and Sharing Bioinformatics Analyses"
tags: ['R', 'tutorial']
---

I was asked to do a half-day tutorial at the [Great Lakes Bioinformatics conference Workshop session](https://www.iscb.org/glbioccbc2016-program/workshops).
The focus was mainly on R, with some python as well.  We covered:

* The basics of Jupyter notebooks - what they are and how they work
* How to install and run Jupyter notebooks on their laptop, in R and Python
* How to perform interactive analyses in a web browser using Jupyter
* Using markdown and latex to
* How to "Port" an R bioinformatics workflow from some scripts into a Jupyter notebook
* How to share a Jupyter notebook online, using three different approaches
    * SageMathCloud
    * GitHub and 
    * mybinder.org

I think it went prety well; the materials are available [On GitHub](https://github.com/ljdursi/glbio-jupyter-workshop).
It was largely hands-on, so apart from some [introductory slides](https://github.com/ljdursi/glbio-jupyter-workshop/blob/master/Slides/Jupyter.pdf),
it was mainly about giving a tour of the notebook and how use Jupyter to share analyses; the "scripts" that I went through
in presenting the material were aimed at having the students produce the notebooks
