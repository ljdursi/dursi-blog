title:  "Understanding Partial Order Alignment for Multiple Sequence Alignment"
tags: ['bioinformatics', 'software']

Over at the [Simpson Lab blog](http://simpsonlab.github.io/blog/), I have an explainer 
on [Understanding Partial Order Alignment](http://simpsonlab.github.io/2015/05/01/understanding-poa/),
an under-appreciated method for multiple sequence alignment; I hope the explanation there
(and [explanatory implementation](https://github.com/ljdursi/poapy)) is useful to those
exploring graph-based approaches to alignment.
