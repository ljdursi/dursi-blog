title:  "The Shell For Scientists"
tags: ['tutorial']
---

I've posted a half-day "The Shell for Scientists"
[tutorial](https://github.com/ljdursi/shell-for-scientists) that
I've given variants on a number of times; the motivating problem,
provided by Greg Wilson for a two-day set of of tutorials at the
University of Toronto, was cleaning up a bunch of auditory lab data
on people's cochlear implants.

The focus is on productivity and automation; PDF slides are available
[here](https://github.com/ljdursi/shell-for-scientists/raw/master/presentation/presentation.pdf)
(although I really should translate them into a markdown-based format to
make them more re-usable).

Covered are a bunch of basics

* echo
* pwd
* cd 
* ls
* man
* file
* cat
* more
* wc
* mv
* cp
* rm
* head
* tail
* sort
* mkdir 
* rmdir 
* grep 
* for..do..done 

And then then there's some optional material on make (again, for
automation) and ssh/scp (because that was frequently necessary for
tutorials at SciNet).
