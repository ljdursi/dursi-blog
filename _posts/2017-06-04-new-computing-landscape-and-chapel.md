tags: ['chapel', 'presentation']

I was invited to speak at this past weekend's fourth annual Chapel Implementers and Users Workshop ([CHIUW 2017](http://chapel.cray.com/CHIUW2017.html)).
It was a great meeting, with lots of extremely high-quality talks on work being done with and on Chapel.  The slides from the presentations
will be up shortly, and I recommend them - the libfabric, KNL, use-after-free tracking, and GraphBLAS works (will link to them as soon as they're up)
were of particular interest to me.  The Code Camp on the next day, working with members the team on individual particular projects, was also a lot
of fun.

The topic of my own talk was &ldquo;Chapel's Home in the Landscape
of New Scientific Computing Languages (and what it can learn from
the neighbours)&rdquo;; the materials from the talk can be found
[on github](http://github.com/ljdursi/CHIUW2017).  I described
the sorts of problems I'm particularly interested in, surveyed
some of the languages/frameworks in there, and tried to identify
what I saw as Chapel's role in the environment.

My slides can be seen below or on [github](http://ljdursi.github.io/CHIUW2017/#1), where [the complete materials can be found](http://github.com/ljdursi/CHIUW2017).
