Hi; I'm Jonathan Dursi.  I've been working in in large-scale computing and data for R&D for around twenty-five years.
My own work was in astrophyics and cancer bioinformatics, but I've also worked with individual researchers and groups
in fields from aerospace to forestry to zoology to answer bigger questions, and national communities to
tackle discipline-wide needs.  Today I lead the building of a [federated genomics platform](https://www.distributedgenomics.ca)
for Canada with a distributed team, and help other groups design and manage their own R&D computing efforts.
