We don’t like to talk about it much in science, but much of the
progression in academia - from undergrad research assistant to
graduate student, postdoc, to Junior PI and beyond - involves a
progression first towards and then away from the actual doing of
science to the coordinating, orchestrating, planning of, and
advocating for scientific projects; or, in other words, management
(though we’d _never_ call it that - more on that later).

But management in an computational-science academic environment is
very different from other areas.  First, academic work is largely
performed by trainees, who have a very different relationship to
their academic supervisor than an employee does to their manager.
At its best, when an academic lab is run by ethical and competent
leadership[^1], significant effort is put into developing those
trainees, giving them increasing responsibilities, and looking for
opportunities for them to apply those emerging skills to new problems.
Second, since much of the work is on open research problems, it’s
very difficult to judge how long something “should” take, so deadlines
in assigning tasks is relatively uncommon.  Third, due to the
open-endedness, the traineeship/apprentice model, and the extreme
independence of senior academics, there is a norm of collegiality,
and being directive about how someone does their work or schedules
their time comes across as very heavy handed; the work output can
be ruthlessly assessed, but the work process is somewhat out-of-bounds.
Fourth, it’s common - maybe even the norm - for projects to be
tackled with others not only outside of the team, but across different
institutions entirely.  Finally, the independence of researchers,
the dynamic nature of research, and the fact that so many coworkers
are elsewhere mean many working relationships are comparatively
transactional and short-lived.

So imagine that you’re a postdoc - the most senior trainee - in a
computational lab, routinely working in multi-institutional
collaborations, and this is where you’re developing your people and
project management chops.  You are directing some particular piece
of research that will lead to publications key for your career.
You aim to be the lead author on one or more of those papers and
you have a clear idea of what must be done.  But your “project team”
are peers or even academics more senior than you, and many are
outside your institution entirely; getting them to do anything is
a matter of persuasion.  Your local, more junior, trainees are just
beginning their journey, and for them to contribute meaningfully
you have to find ways to develop their skills and the best ways to
take advantage of those skills.  You want everyone to be invested,
contributing, and upping their skills, and you don’t have interest
in telling people how to do their work even if you did have the
time to be that prescriptive; but everything needs to be done, and
quickly, because you’ll be on the job market next year and you
learned at a conference that a competitor’s lab is looking into
some of the same questions.  What kind of skills are you developing
as you’re thrust into this situation?

. . . 

Much of the computing and technical world is teaching itself things
about management that the rest of the world has known for a
half-century.  Famously, the Google Oxygen project, which was at
least in part aimed at “proving” that management does not matter,
started in 2008 looking at management across teams in the organization,
and found that it really does.[^2]  (Surprise!).  Their original findings
[identified 8 characteristics of managers of particularly successful
teams](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/the-8-biggest-things-that-google-managers-do-to-su.html)[^2],
and 3 pitfalls managers in less successful teams fell into.

Those characteristics of good managers, in decreasing order of importance:

1. They're good coaches.
2. They empower their team and don't micro-manage.
3. They express interest in their team members' success and personal well-being.
4. They productive and results-oriented.
5. They're good communicators and they listen to the team.
6. They help employees with career development.
7. They have a clear vision and strategy for the team.
8. They have key technical skills that help them advise the team.[^3]

How will our postdoc rate against those criteria?  They are going
to be very concerned with skills development in their direct reports,
encouraging them on to bigger and better things - teaching them to
be good coaches (1), invested in their team members success (half
of 3), and helping them with their career avancement, 6.  They
certainly won’t micromanage (2); they understand the big-picture
goals they’re trying to achieve very clearly (7) and are focused
on the steps to get there (4); presumably their relevant technical
skills are excellent (8); and because they can’t rely on role power
or authority to coordinate the getting done of work, they are going
to develop the communication skills necessary to communicate with
and listen to the team, at least around tasks (5).

That’s just about a clean sweep!  I claim that the sort of
training that I’ve seen people get on projects in computational
science or large-observational or theoretical science collaborations
equips people with the advanced skills to become great managers.

there’s a downside, too.  The very hands-off approach to management (indeed, the refusal to countenance that “management” is even an appropriate thing for scientists to stoop to) means that some of the more basic, fundamental, skills are lacking.  The same early work at Google pointed out key shortcomings of their less successful managers:

1. Have trouble making a transition to the team.
2. Lack a consistent approach to performance management.
3. Spend too little time managing and communicating.

And those start to look like real sticking points for our postdoc.
Almost no one is taught management skills before their first
management position, but scientists are more or less taught that
management _shouldn’t_ be done; “we’re not that sort of people”.
Our postdoc is going to spend little to no time actually managing.
Performance communications - giving people regular feedback on their
work, rather than waiting weeks or months for some big sub project
to be done and then commenting on the finished project - is going
to be completely foreign, if not anathema, to them.   Making the
transition to being the manager of the team is going to be doubly
difficult - both internalizing their role as a manager, and by
putting the time in to develop really solid working relationships
with the team members.

So while many or even all of the advanced skills might well be in
place for scientist trainees to excel at management outside of the
academy, the basic skills - and even models of what the basic skills
would look like - are often going to be lacking.

But those basic skills are the easiest to address!  There are several
resources now which focus on the nitty-gritty of doing the everyday
things that mangers need to do - anyone can do them, and someone
who’s spent a good chunk of their career in the sciences _certainly_
can.  Maybe it’s where I’ve been looking, but to me it seems like
the strongest resources that really nail the basics come from people
on the more technical side.  I’m a huge fan of [Manager
Tools](https://www.manager-tools.com), which have amassed a huge
library a “here’s a number of steps you can start taking today”
podcasts and a couple of books, with data to back them up.  A number
of colleagues really like [The Manager’s Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/)
which takes a career-long view of stepping up the career letter
(set in the tech industry but most of the material would carry over
to other fields) and the different skills and responsibilities
needed at each stage.
