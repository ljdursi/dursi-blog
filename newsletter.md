R&D Computing is a tough field that combines the challenges of many disciplines.

Like IT or commercial software development, we need to deliver real usable tools
to support our users; but like research, our projects are often extremely open-ended,
with complexity coming not from unvalidated requirements but the uncertaintainty
of the new, requiring experimentation and discovery.  Like academia,
we often work with team members who are trainees, not employees; like nonprofits
we are called on to enact real changes with ongoing programmes or products while
funded only by budgets dependent on multiple short-term grants.

But while there are many websites and podcasts, newsletters and tutorials, on the
bytes and flops and Mbit/s of R&D computing, there is very little out there on the 
genuinely hard day-to-day work of designing, building and managing R&D computing
teams, projects, and software.  Commercial or open-source software development,
research, nonprofit, IT, business - our field is too different for advice from
those fields to routinely directly carry over, even if there are lessons we can
learn from them.

This is a newsletter, starting mid-to-late Feb 2020, covering "Everything about
R&D computing except the computers".  

## The intended audience

* Trained in or experienced with research
* Technically capable in R&D computing
* Responsible, or intending to be responsible, for managing or designing R&D computing teams or efforts
* Looking for information on and a community around managing R&D computing teams and efforts

## The format

* Short emails roughly every weekday on the care and feeding of R&D computing teams and efforts
* Weekly link roundups with occasional longer posts
* Reply to any message (it'll go directly to me and only to me) with thoughts, comments, and feedback.

## The content

Feedback from subscribers will greatly shape the topics we cover.  Likely early topics include:

- Hiring
    - Hiring from outside research, writing job ads, onboarding, the responsibility ladder
- Managing
    - One-on-Ones, giving feedback, coaching and training, distributed teams
- &ldquo;Managing upwards&rdquo;
    - Building and sustaining support for projects, shepharding multi-institution collaborations, communications
- Career paths, for our team members and ourselves
- R&D computing and academic credit
- Automation and reproducibility
- R&D Software planning and development throughout the lifecycle
- Grants and Sustainability

Issues that would _not_ be on topic include GPU vs FPGA, POSIX vs Object stores, Python vs C++, etc; 
on the other hand, a story about why and how an R&D computing team planned and succeeded at 
a migration from GPU/POSIX/Python to FPGA/Object Store/C++ might well be on topic.  

(Jonathan's twitter rants about things like MPI and exascale will **not** be on topic for this newsletter.)

## FAQs

**Q: So you are an expert on this stuff, right?** <br/>
A: Absolutely not.  I have a lot of experience in this area from a lot of different perspectives,
but I continue to make obvious rookie mistakes.  I continue trying to learn and improve, and 
anyone interested is welcome to join.

**Q: Will the posts be archived anywhere?** <br/>
A: No - these are short discussions and links-of-the-week with commentary; the topics we discuss
will frequently end up developing into longer-form blog posts, but the emails themselves aren't
writings that need preserving.

**Q: Will there be tracking of the emails?** <br/>
A: No.  Email tracking is creepy.

**Q: Then how will you tell which emails people found interesting or useful?** <br/>
A: Well, I'm kind of hoping that you'll just tell me!

**Q: Will my email address get sold/used for anything else?** <br/>
A: No.  I'll use it only for sending you my thoughts on R&D computing teams, and when you no longer care to continue hearing those thoughts, unsubscribe at any time, and I'll remove the unsubscribed member's information routinely.  No one other than me and
whatever tool I'm using at the time to send out the newsletter will ever have access to your email address.

## Resources

Below are resources on intended topics that I've found to be useful in the past.
I'll keep this list updated with sources that come up in the link roundups.

* General managment topics
    - [Manager-Tools](https://www.manager-tools.com) - kind of the OG of management podcasts and resources; focuses on super-detailed actionable recommendations.
    - [Harvard Buisness Review](https://hbr.org) - 2/3 aspirational "leadership" stuff, 1/3 surprisingly useful insights on a range of topics.
* Software development managment
    - [Rand in Repose](https://randsinrepose.com) - both the books and the very active slack community
    - [The Manager's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/) - an extremely useful book on the increasing responsibilities of software development
    - [Re:work at Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/)
* Nonprofit management
    - [The Good Partnership](https://www.thegoodpartnership.com)
    - [Joan Garry](https://www.joangarry.com)
* Data-science teams
    - [The Care and Feeding of Data Science Teams](https://oreilly-ds-report.s3.amazonaws.com/Care_and_Feeding_of_Data_Scientists.pdf)
